# DC-Signals

This Signals-Slot implementation is based on the following implementations:
- https://github.com/pbhogan/Signals
- https://github.com/NoAvailableAlias/nano-signal-slot

The purpose was to have a simplified version, more easily understandable and readable. 
The number of classes and types have been reduced to only two (CSignal and CConnection). 
It has also being built imitating the way signals2 works in the boost library.
